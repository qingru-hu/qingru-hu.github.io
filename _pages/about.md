Hi, I am Qingru Hu 胡清茹, a second-year graduate student at the Department of Astronomy, Tsinghua University. My research interests mainly focus on the dynamics behind gravitationally-bound astronomical systems, from small bodies in our Solar System to stars around merging binary black holes. I utilize N-body simulation as well as analytical analysis to unveil the formation mystery of the amazing celestial bodies we have observed.

I am pursuing my PhD degree in Astronomy at Tsinghua University under the supervision of Prof. [Wei Zhu](https://i.astro.tsinghua.edu.cn/~wzhu/). I earned my Bachelor's degree of Science at the Tsinghua University in 2024.

In addition to science, I enjoy visiting museums and galleries. I also like hiking and travelling. Below is a photo I took of the Beijing CBD at sunset during the hiking route of 香巴拉.
