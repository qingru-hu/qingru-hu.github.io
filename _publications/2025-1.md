Sedna-like objects (a.k.a. sednoids) are trans-Neptunian objects (TNOs) characterized by large semimajor axes and exceptionally high perihelia. Their high-q orbits are detached from the influence of the four giant planets and need extra perturbation to form. One hypothesis posits that close stellar flybys could have perturbed objects from the primordial scattering disk, generating the sednoid population. In this study, we run N-body simulations with different stellar encounter configurations to explore whether such a close stellar flyby can satisfy new constraints identified from sednoid (and detached extreme TNO) observation, including the low-inclination ($$i < 30^{\circ}$$) profile and primordial orbital alignment. Our results suggest that flybys with field stars are unable to generate a sufficient population, whereas flybys within the birth cluster fail to produce the primordial orbital alignment. To meet the inclination constraint of detached extreme TNOs, flybys have to be either coplanar ($$i_{\star}\sim 0^{\circ}$$) or symmetric about the ecliptic plane ($$ω_\star \sim 0^{\circ}, i_\star\sim 90^{\circ}$$). After taking into account their occurrence rate at the early stage of the solar system, we conclude that close-in stellar flybys ($$q_\star \leq 1000$$au) that satisfy all constraints are unlikely to happen ($$\leq5\%$$).
