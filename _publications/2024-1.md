In this work, we present a new Rossiter–McLaughlin measurement of the tidally detached warm Jupiter TOI-677 b, obtained using high-precision radial velocity observations with Magellan's Planet Finder Spectrograph (PFS). Combined with previously published observations from the Very Large Telescope's ESPRESSO spectrograph, we derive one of the most precisely constrained sky-projected spin–orbit angle measurements to date for an exoplanet. The combined fit offers a refined set of self-consistent parameters, including a low sky-projected stellar obliquity of $$\lambda ={3\buildrel{\circ}\over{.} 2}_{-{1.}^{\circ }5}^{+{1.}^{\circ }6}$$ and a moderately high eccentricity of $$e={0.460}_{-0.018}^{+0.019}$$, which further constrain the puzzling architecture of this system. This system adds to a growing population of aligned warm Jupiters on eccentric orbits around hot ($$T_{\rm eff} > 6100$$ K) stars.
